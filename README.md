# Regional-Sales-Project-EDA

**Problem Statement:** 
“Sales teams often lack a clear, data-driven understanding of regional performance, making it difficult to identify growth opportunities and optimize resources. This project aims to analyse and visualize regional sales data to uncover trends, evaluate profitability, and support strategic decision-making.”

This repository outlines my exploratory data analysis (EDA) on regional sales across USA. This project has been implemented using Python on Google Colab and Google slides to present my findings. 

**Project Objective:**
The objective of this project was to analyse the regional performance of 30 products across USA by exporting, cleaning, organising and then performing EDA on the excel dataset in Google Colab. The intended outcome was to provide actionable insights into increasing profit performances, channel profibility, and optimise business strategies to combat seasonal swings. 

**Tools Used:**
 - Google Colab - Python 3
 - Google Slides - to create the presentation deck
 - Github - to document the project
